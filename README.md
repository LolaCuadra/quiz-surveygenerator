# Overview

As a software engineer certifying in Web Development I thought it will be a great idea to give myself a head start on TypeScrip with this basic quiz/survey taker.

I installed node along with the TypeScript on my computer, then watch a couple of youtube videos to guide myself, and get a better idea on how to go about it. 

I was able to start working on this project faster than I expected when I realized TypeScript and JavaScript use the same syntax. :)

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to write this little challenge for myself. Wrote in TypeScript and trsnferred to JavaScript for it to run.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I could use html to make my code be visible in the browser and not only in the terminal
- I could add a feature to save the quizzes people make in a Json file and for them to be able to edit them, or look at them later
